# THE MURDER CASTLE

This Python-based text based adventure game is loosely based on the history of H. H Holmes, a serial killer from America that allegedly clamed at least 27 lives in his [Murder Castle](https://www.history.com/topics/crime/murder-castle#section_2). 
I first learned about this case by [The Poisoner's Cabinet podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90seA7T9GU).
I've also taken inspiration from the [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Pictures_Anthology:_The_Devil_in_Me) "The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me" by Supermassive Games.

Throughout the game, there are multiple choices leading either to death or survival, and depending on what choices you make along the way, your chance of escaping the Murder Castle increases. Or decreases.

As a true crime enthusiast, the idea came naturally, and creating all the rooms with this as inspiration was highly enjoyable.
